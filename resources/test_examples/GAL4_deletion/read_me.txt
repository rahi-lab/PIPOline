input1:
min_homology = 100 max_homology = 500

Solution:
MscI used for digestion of the 3' end (RS0)
MCS cut with: XhoI (AbsI is equally good for this site) and SacI



input 2:
min_homology = 200 max_homology = 500
alpha = 1.2 (plasmid is assembled for this case)

Solution:
HindIII used for digestion of the 3' end (RS0)
MCS cut with: XhoI (AbsI is equally good for this site) and SacI
